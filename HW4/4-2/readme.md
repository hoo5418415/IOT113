#Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster üö¢
This project is a solution to the Kaggle competition Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster. The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on their characteristics using machine learning. This repository follows the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology to ensure a systematic and structured approach.

CRISP-DM Methodology üõ†Ô∏è
---
1. Business Understanding
Objective: Predict the survival of Titanic passengers (binary classification: Survived = 1 or 0).
Impact: Understanding the factors affecting survival can provide insights into safety procedures and disaster management.
Dataset: The dataset consists of the following:
train.csv: Training data (contains Survived label).
test.csv: Test data (used for prediction and submission).
Dataset Link
---
2. Data Understanding
We first explore the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.

Columns:

Survived: Target variable (1 = survived, 0 = did not survive).
Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd).
Sex: Gender of the passenger.
Age: Age of the passenger.
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard.
Fare: Ticket fare.
Embarked: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).
Other features such as Cabin and Name were reviewed for possible importance.
Initial Observations:

Missing values in Age, Cabin, and Embarked.
Categorical columns (Sex, Embarked) need encoding.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizations (bar charts, histograms) were used to analyze feature relationships with survival rates.
---
3. Data Preparation
Steps:

Handle Missing Values:

Age: Imputed with the median.
Embarked: Imputed with the mode.
Cabin: Dropped due to a large number of missing values.
Feature Engineering:

Created FamilySize = SibSp + Parch + 1 to represent family grouping.
Extracted Title from Name to capture social status.
Binned Fare and Age into categorical ranges to capture non-linearity.
Encoding Categorical Variables:

One-hot encoded Sex and Embarked.
Scaling Numeric Features:

Used StandardScaler to scale numeric columns (Age, Fare).
Final Split:

Split the train.csv into training and validation sets using an 80:20 ratio.
---
4. Modeling
Multiple machine learning algorithms were tested, and hyperparameter optimization was used to fine-tune their performance.

---
5. Evaluation
The model was evaluated using the validation set, with the following metrics:

Accuracy
Confusion Matrix
Precision, Recall, F1-Score

4. Modeling
Multiple machine learning algorithms were tested, and hyperparameter optimization was used to fine-tune their performance.

Algorithms Tested:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)
Hyperparameter Optimization:
Used Optuna for Bayesian Optimization to maximize accuracy through hyperparameter tuning.
Example of hyperparameter optimization for Random Forest:

python
Ë§áË£ΩÁ®ãÂºèÁ¢º
import optuna
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

def objective(trial):
    n_estimators = trial.suggest_int("n_estimators", 50, 500)
    max_depth = trial.suggest_int("max_depth", 3, 20)
    min_samples_split = trial.suggest_int("min_samples_split", 2, 20)
    min_samples_leaf = trial.suggest_int("min_samples_leaf", 1, 10)
    max_features = trial.suggest_categorical("max_features", ["auto", "sqrt", "log2"])

    model = RandomForestClassifier(
        n_estimators=n_estimators,
        max_depth=max_depth,
        min_samples_split=min_samples_split,
        min_samples_leaf=min_samples_leaf,
        max_features=max_features,
        random_state=42,
    )

    scores = cross_val_score(model, X_train, y_train, cv=5, scoring="accuracy")
    return scores.mean()

study = optuna.create_study(direction="maximize")
study.optimize(objective, n_trials=50)

print("Best hyperparameters:", study.best_params)
Selected Model:

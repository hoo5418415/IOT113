# Titanic Survival Prediction using PyCaret

This project uses the **CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)** methodology to predict Titanic passenger survival using machine learning models. The implementation is performed with the help of PyCaret, a low-code machine learning library.

## 1. Business Understanding

The Titanic disaster poses a binary classification problem:  
**Objective:** Predict whether a passenger survived (`1`) or not (`0`) based on their attributes like age, gender, ticket class, etc.

**Dataset:**  
- **Train Set:** Used to build and train the machine learning models.  
- **Test Set:** Used to evaluate the model's predictions.  

**Evaluation Metric:**  
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score for model comparison.

## 2. Data Understanding

The dataset consists of the following attributes:

| Feature          | Description                          |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------|
| PassengerId      | Unique identifier for each passenger |
| Survived         | Target variable (1 = Survived, 0 = Not) |
| Pclass           | Ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)        |
| Name             | Passenger's full name               |
| Sex              | Gender                              |
| Age              | Age in years                        |
| SibSp            | # of siblings/spouses aboard        |
| Parch            | # of parents/children aboard        |
| Ticket           | Ticket number                       |
| Fare             | Passenger fare                      |
| Cabin            | Cabin number                        |
| Embarked         | Port of embarkation (C/Q/S)         |

## 3. Data Preparation

Steps performed to clean and preprocess the dataset:

1. **Handling Missing Values**:  
   - `Age`: Filled missing values with the median.  
   - `Embarked`: Filled missing values with the mode.  
   - `Fare`: Filled missing values with the median.  

2. **Feature Engineering**:  
   - Encoded categorical features (`Sex`, `Embarked`) using one-hot encoding.  
   - Dropped unnecessary features (`PassengerId`, `Name`, `Ticket`, `Cabin`) as they don't contribute significantly to survival prediction.  

3. **Final Data Structure**:  
   After preprocessing, the dataset includes numeric features only, suitable for machine learning algorithms.

## 4. Modeling

Using **PyCaret**, a low-code machine learning library, we compared multiple classification models.

### Steps:

1. **Setup PyCaret Environment**:
    ```python
    from pycaret.classification import setup, compare_models

    clf_setup = setup(data=train_data, target='Survived', silent=True, session_id=123)
    ```
2. **Compare Models**:
    ```python
    best_model = compare_models()
    print("Best Model: ", best_model)
    ```

PyCaret automatically evaluates a variety of classification models and selects the one with the best performance.

## 5. Evaluation

The following metrics are used to evaluate the model's performance:

- **Accuracy**: How often the model is correct.  
- **Precision**: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives.  
- **Recall**: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all observations in the actual class.  
- **F1-Score**: Weighted average of Precision and Recall.

PyCaret provides a comparative table and visualizations for each model evaluated during the `compare_models()` step.

## 6. Deployment

The selected model can be used to predict survival on the test dataset. Below is an example of loading the PyCaret environment and applying the model to new data:

```python
from pycaret.classification import load_model, predict_model

# Load saved model and environment
model = load_model('pycaret_titanic_env')

# Preprocess test dataset (similar steps as train dataset)
test_data = pd.read_csv("test.csv")
# Apply necessary preprocessing...

# Predict survival
predictions = predict_model(model, data=test_data)
print(predictions[['PassengerId', 'Label']])

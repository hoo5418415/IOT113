 1.Generate Python code to solve the Kaggle Boston Housing Regression problem with following steps

      1.Import the necessary libraries and download the dataset using a web crawler. Use the URL "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/GaneshSparkz/b5662effbdae8746f7f7d8ed70c42b2d/raw/faf8b1a0d58e251f48a647d3881e7a960c3f0925/50_Startups.csv" to fetch the dataset. Convert the CSV content to a pandas DataFrame and print a summary of the dataset. Then Load the dataset and explore its contents.
      
      2.preprocess the data to feature(x) and target(y),and use one hot encodings on State variable,and split dataset into training and testing sets using a test size of 20%.
      
      3.build the model and use linear regression method,train the data to fit the model
      
      4.Evalulate the model,and use Lasso to select the features
      
      5.Make predictions on the test data, calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) using the predicted values, and print the MSE.

2.great ,also can you write the comments follow the CRISP-DM Steps,and output the data using mark-down format
(生出第二版homework2_詳細註解.py)

3.I want CRISP-DM steps show following markDown Language,so I can use github readme.md to show the step

# CRISP-DM: Step 1 - Business Understanding

**Objective**: Predict the profit of a startup based on R&D Spend, Administration, Marketing Spend, and State.

We'll use regression models to predict the target variable (Profit) from the available features.


# CRISP-DM: Step 2 - Data Understanding

**Dataset Overview**:
- We have a dataset consisting of 50 startups and various features like:
  - **R&D Spend**
  - **Administration**
  - **Marketing Spend**
  - **State**
  - **Profit** (our target variable)

**Steps**:
1. Import necessary libraries.
2. Download and load the dataset.
3. Summarize the dataset to understand the structure and contents.


# CRISP-DM: Step 3 - Data Preparation

**Data Preparation Steps**:
1. Split the dataset into **features** (X) and **target** (y).
2. Perform **one-hot encoding** on the 'State' column to convert categorical data to numerical.
3. Split the dataset into **training** (80%) and **testing** (20%) subsets.

**Training Data Shape**: {X_train.shape}
**Test Data Shape**: {X_test.shape}


# CRISP-DM: Step 4 - Modeling

**Modeling Approach**:
- We use **Linear Regression** to predict the startup's profit.
- The model is trained using the training data (`X_train` and `y_train`).


# CRISP-DM: Step 5 - Evaluation (Linear Regression)

**Evaluation Metric**: 
- We use **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** to evaluate the model's performance on the test set.

**Linear Regression MSE**: {mse}


# CRISP-DM: Step 6 - Evaluation and Feature Selection (Lasso)

**Lasso Regression** is used to perform feature selection by shrinking coefficients of less important features to zero.

**Lasso Regression MSE**: {mse_lasso}

**Selected Features** (non-zero coefficients):
{lasso_coef[lasso_coef != 0]}


# CRISP-DM: Step 7 - Final Predictions

Here are the final predictions made using the **Lasso model**:

{y_pred_lasso}


# 最終結果

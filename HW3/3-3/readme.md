Generate 600 random points centered at the coordinates (0,0) with a variance of 10. Assign each point a label: Y=0 for points located at a distance less than 4 from the origin, and Y=1 for points at a greater distance. After generating and labeling the points, create a scatter plot visualizing the data.

# Random Dataset Generation with Non-Circular Distribution

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to generate a synthetic dataset of 600 points that follow a **non-circular** (elliptical) distribution. Each point is labeled based on its **distance** from the origin `(0, 0)`:

- **Label Y=0** for points within a distance of 4 units from the origin.
- **Label Y=1** for points further than 4 units.

The points are distributed with **anisotropic** variance, creating an elliptical distribution. The dataset is visualized using a **scatter plot**, and the results are displayed interactively via **Streamlit**.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to:

1. **Generate a synthetic dataset** of 600 random points with a **non-circular** (elliptical) distribution in a 2D feature space.
2. **Label the points** based on their distance from the origin `(0, 0)`, where:
   - `Y=0`: Points within 4 units of the origin.
   - `Y=1`: Points further than 4 units from the origin.
3. **Visualize** the dataset interactively using **Streamlit**, where the points with labels `Y=0` and `Y=1` are color-coded differently.

## Dataset Generation

### 1. **Generate Random Points**

The dataset is generated by sampling points from a **bivariate normal distribution** (Gaussian distribution). This allows for control over the variance and covariance along the x and y axes, resulting in an elliptical distribution.

- **Mean Vector**: The dataset is centered at the origin, `(0, 0)`, meaning the mean vector is `[0, 0]`.
- **Covariance Matrix**: This matrix defines the spread and correlation between the x and y axes. By setting different variances along each axis and adding correlation, we create the desired elliptical distribution.

### 2. **Number of Points**
600 random points are generated from the bivariate normal distribution using the specified mean and covariance matrix.

## Data Labeling

Each point is labeled based on its **Euclidean distance** from the origin `(0, 0)`. The Euclidean distance formula is:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

- **Label Y=0**: Points whose distance from the origin is less than 4 units.
- **Label Y=1**: Points whose distance from the origin is greater than or equal to 4 units.

This labeling is applied using a simple distance check for each point.

## Data Visualization

The dataset is visualized using a **scatter plot**, where points are color-coded according to their label:

- **Blue points (Y=0)**: Represent points within 4 units from the origin.
- **Red points (Y=1)**: Represent points further than 4 units from the origin.

The visualization is made interactive using **Streamlit**, allowing users to explore the plot dynamically. You can zoom in, zoom out, and move around the plot to better understand the distribution of the points.

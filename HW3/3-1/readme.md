Implement a system to perform logistic regression and SVM on a set of 300 randomly generated variables, and visualize the results.

1. **Generate Data:**
   - Generate 300 random variables, \(X(i)\), with values ranging from 0 to 1000.
   - Determine \(Y(i)\) using the rule: \(Y(i) = 1\) if \(500 < X(i) < 800\), otherwise \(Y(i) = 0\).

2. **Model Building:**
   - Perform logistic regression to predict the binary outcomes, outputting results as \(y1\).
   - Perform a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification to predict the binary outcomes, outputting results as \(y2\).

3. **Visualization:**
   - Create a plot for \(X\) and \(Y\) (actual data) alongside logistic regression predictions \((X, Y1)\).
   - Create a separate plot for \(X\) and \(Y\) (actual data) alongside SVM predictions \((X, Y2)\).
   - Include decision boundaries (hyperplanes) for logistic regression and SVM in their respective plots.

# Steps

1. Generate 300 random variables \(X(i)\) in the range of 0 to 1000.
2. Determine \(Y(i)\) based on the condition \(Y(i)=1\) if \(500 < X(i) < 800\), otherwise \(Y(i)=0\).
3. Implement a logistic regression model to predict the outcomes \((y1)\).
4. Implement a support vector machine model to predict the outcomes \((y2)\).
5. Plot the actual data and logistic regression predictions, showing relevant decision boundaries.
6. Plot the actual data and SVM predictions, showing relevant decision boundaries.

# Output Format

- Two plots should be generated:
  1. A plot with actual data \((X, Y)\) and logistic regression results \((X, Y1)\), including the decision boundary.
  2. A plot with actual data \((X, Y)\) and SVM results \((X, Y2)\), including the decision boundary.

# Notes

- Ensure that plots clearly depict the data points and decision boundaries for easy interpretation.
- Utilize appropriate libraries for machine learning (e.g., scikit-learn) and visualization (e.g., matplotlib) in Python.
- Randomness in data generation should be controlled (e.g., using a fixed seed) to allow reproducibility.

# Logistic Regression and SVM on Random Data

This project demonstrates the use of Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for binary classification on a randomly generated dataset. The goal is to predict binary outcomes based on a set of random variables and visualize the decision boundaries of the models. The project follows the **CRISP-DM** methodology, which stands for **Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining**.

---

## CRISP-DM Steps

### 1. **Business Understanding**
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models can be applied to a simple binary classification task. Specifically, given a set of random variables \(X(i)\), we aim to predict the binary outcome \(Y(i)\) using these models. The target variable \(Y(i)\) is defined by the following rule:
- \(Y(i) = 1\) if \(500 < X(i) < 800\)
- \(Y(i) = 0\) otherwise.

This task serves as an educational exercise to showcase the implementation of two classification algorithms and their visualization techniques.

### 2. **Data Understanding**
In this step, we generate the dataset to be used for classification. The dataset consists of 300 data points, each represented by a single feature \(X(i)\). The corresponding target variable \(Y(i)\) is determined using the rule mentioned above.

- **Feature \(X(i)\)**: A set of 300 random values between 0 and 1000.
- **Target \(Y(i)\)**: A binary outcome variable where:
  - \(Y(i) = 1\) if \(500 < X(i) < 800\)
  - \(Y(i) = 0\) otherwise.

This simple rule helps to simulate a real-world binary classification problem where a clear distinction can be made based on the range of values for \(X(i)\).

### 3. **Data Preparation**
Once the dataset is generated, we prepare it for use in machine learning models. The data is already in a suitable format for training classification models:
- **X**: The feature matrix, where each data point consists of a single value (i.e., the random number between 0 and 1000).
- **Y**: The target vector, which contains the binary values based on the classification rule.

No additional preprocessing or feature engineering is needed in this case, as the data is already in the appropriate form for training machine learning models.

### 4. **Modeling**
In this step, we apply two machine learning algorithms to the data: **Logistic Regression** and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**. These models are used to predict the binary target variable \(Y(i)\) based on the feature \(X(i)\).

#### Logistic Regression:
- Logistic Regression is a probabilistic model that predicts the probability of a binary outcome. It estimates the probability of \(Y = 1\) given \(X(i)\) using a sigmoid function.
- The decision boundary for logistic regression is a smooth curve (sigmoid), and the model assigns a probability for each prediction.

#### Support Vector Machine (SVM):
- SVM is a supervised learning algorithm that finds the optimal hyperplane (or decision boundary) that separates the data into two classes.
- In this case, we use a **linear kernel**, which will produce a straight decision boundary to classify the data into two classes.

Both models are trained using the generated dataset. The predictions from each model are compared with the true labels, and their performance is evaluated.

### 5. **Evaluation**
After training both models, we evaluate their performance using accuracy as the metric. The accuracy is the percentage of correct predictions made by each model on the test data. We calculate the accuracy for both **Logistic Regression** and **SVM**.

- **Logistic Regression Accuracy**: Measures how well the logistic regression model predicts the binary outcomes.
- **SVM Accuracy**: Measures how well the SVM model predicts the binary outcomes.

We use the **`accuracy_score()`** function from `sklearn.metrics` to calculate the accuracy of both models.

### 6. **Deployment**
While this project is a demonstration, in real-world scenarios, deployment would involve taking the trained models and using them to make predictions on new, unseen data. The deployment could involve integrating the models into an application or service that takes input data and provides predictions based on the trained model.

In this case, we focus more on the analysis and visualization rather than deployment.

### 7. **Visualization**
Visualization is an essential part of understanding the performance of machine learning models. We create two plots to compare the actual data points with the model predictions and their respective decision boundaries.

#### Plot 1: Logistic Regression Results
- The first plot displays the actual data points (in blue) and the predictions made by the logistic regression model (in red).
- The decision boundary for the logistic regression model is displayed as a green curve, representing the threshold where the model predicts \(Y = 1\) or \(Y = 0\).

#### Plot 2: SVM Results
- The second plot displays the actual data points (in blue) and the predictions made by the SVM model (in red).
- The decision boundary for the SVM model is displayed as a green line, representing the linear separation between the two classes.

The decision boundaries help visualize how each model separates the data into the two classes, providing insight into how each algorithm works.

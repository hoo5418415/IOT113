# Iris Classification using PyTorch Lightning

## CRISP-DM Process Overview
This project follows the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology to solve the Iris classification problem using PyTorch Lightning. Below, we break down each step of the process.

### 1. Business Understanding
The goal is to classify iris flowers into one of three species: Setosa, Versicolour, or Virginica, based on four features â€” sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. This project aims to create a neural network model to achieve high classification accuracy on this dataset.

### 2. Data Understanding
The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in machine learning and contains:
- 150 samples
- 4 features per sample (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width)
- 3 classes (Setosa, Versicolour, Virginica)

We use the `load_iris()` function from `sklearn.datasets` to load the dataset.

### 3. Data Preparation
- **Standardization**: The feature values are standardized using `StandardScaler` to have zero mean and unit variance.
- **Train-Validation Split**: The data is split into training (80%) and validation (20%) sets using `train_test_split()`.
- **Tensor Conversion**: The datasets are converted into PyTorch tensors to be used for model training.

### 4. Modeling
- **Model Architecture**: A simple feedforward neural network with one hidden layer of 16 units and ReLU activation.
- **Training**: The model is trained using PyTorch Lightning with `cross_entropy` loss and the Adam optimizer.

### 5. Evaluation
- **Metrics**: Training and validation accuracy are logged using TensorBoard.
- **Validation**: The validation set is used to evaluate the model's generalization performance during training.

### 6. Deployment
For deployment, the trained model can be saved and used to make predictions on new data. TensorBoard is used to visualize training metrics.

### Summary
This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of data mining using the CRISP-DM methodology to classify iris flowers using a neural network built with PyTorch Lightning. The process involves understanding the problem, preparing the data, modeling, evaluation, and potential deployment.

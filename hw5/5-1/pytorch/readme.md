# CRISP-DM Steps for Iris Classification Using PyTorch

## 1. Business Understanding
The objective of this project is to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. This classification is based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal is to automate the flower species recognition process with high accuracy using machine learning techniques.

## 2. Data Understanding
The dataset used is the well-known Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples, with 50 samples for each of the three species. Each sample has four numerical features:
- **Sepal Length**
- **Sepal Width**
- **Petal Length**
- **Petal Width**

The dataset is loaded using the `load_iris()` function from the `sklearn.datasets` module. It is divided into input features (`X`) and target labels (`y`).

## 3. Data Preparation
- **Feature Scaling**: The features are standardized using `StandardScaler` to ensure they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This improves the convergence of the neural network model.
- **Train-Test Split**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets in an 80-20 ratio using `train_test_split()` from `sklearn.model_selection`. This ensures that the model is evaluated on unseen data, giving a realistic measure of its performance.
- **Conversion to PyTorch Tensors**: The training and test datasets are converted to PyTorch tensors for compatibility with the neural network training process.

## 4. Modeling
- **Neural Network Definition**: A simple feedforward neural network (`IrisNet`) is defined with two fully connected layers:
  - **Input Layer**: 4 nodes representing the features.
  - **Hidden Layer**: 16 nodes with ReLU activation to introduce non-linearity.
  - **Output Layer**: 3 nodes, each representing one of the iris species.
- **Loss Function and Optimizer**: The loss function used is Cross Entropy Loss (`nn.CrossEntropyLoss()`), suitable for multi-class classification. The optimizer is Adam (`optim.Adam`) with a learning rate of 0.01, chosen for its efficiency in training.

## 5. Evaluation
- **Training Loop**: The model is trained for 50 epochs. In each epoch, the following steps are performed:
  - Zero the gradients of the optimizer.
  - Perform a forward pass to calculate the output and compute the loss.
  - Perform a backward pass to compute gradients.
  - Update model parameters using the optimizer.
- **TensorBoard Logging**: Training loss and test accuracy are logged for each epoch using TensorBoard (`SummaryWriter`) to visualize model performance over time.
- **Model Evaluation**: After each epoch, the model's performance on the test set is evaluated. Accuracy is calculated by comparing the predicted labels with the true labels.

## 6. Deployment
The trained model can be saved and used to classify new samples of iris flowers. The metrics logged in TensorBoard allow for monitoring model training and evaluation, providing insights into whether further tuning is needed.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of the CRISP-DM methodology to solve a classification problem using PyTorch. The workflow includes understanding the business objective, preparing the data, defining and training the model, and evaluating its performance. TensorBoard is used to monitor the training process, making it easier to visualize and understand model improvements over time.

# chatgpt Prompt
Write a README for a project that uses TensorFlow's Keras to create a CNN for MNIST digit classification. Include CRISP-DM steps such as Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation, and Deployment.

# CRISP-DM Steps Documentation

## Step 1: Business Understanding
The objective of this project is to classify handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This classification can be used for tasks such as automated data entry and digital recognition systems.

## Step 2: Data Understanding
The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits. Each image is 28x28 pixels. The dataset is split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

- **Training Set Size**: 60,000 images
- **Test Set Size**: 10,000 images
- **Image Dimensions**: 28x28 pixels, single channel (grayscale)
- **Labels**: 10 classes (digits 0-9)

## Step 3: Data Preparation
The images are reshaped to include a single channel (28x28x1) and normalized to have pixel values between 0 and 1. The labels are one-hot encoded to represent 10 classes.

## Step 4: Modeling
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is built using `tf.keras.Sequential`. The model consists of:
- 3 convolutional layers with ReLU activation
- MaxPooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions
- A fully connected layer with 64 units and ReLU activation
- An output layer with 10 units and softmax activation for classification

## Step 5: Evaluation
The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function. It is trained for 5 epochs with a batch size of 64, and 10% of the training data is used for validation.
The model is then evaluated on the test set to determine its accuracy.

## Step 6: Deployment
The trained model can be saved and deployed for real-time digit classification in applications such as mobile apps, web services, or embedded systems. For this demonstration, we simply evaluated the model's accuracy on the test set.
